# Introducing Myself

HiðŸ‘‹, my name is Joshua. I'm 18, and I love to code, and learn new language every now & then.
I'm currently learning, Machine Learning & data science. I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects as much as I can, because I believe it will help me in my learning process as well as in gaining experience with logic building and problem solving skills. Feel free to reach me out on Instagram below.
